######################## t-test (Testing the difference between 2 groups) ###############################

# 1. Checking whether the two groups of stimuli are equal by some feature - averaging

# For this case, we are using t test for independent samples

t.test(logF~ Concreteness_category , data = data1)

# We can see that two conditions are not statisticaly different by word frequency, because the p value
# is above 0.05

# 2. Checking the differences in RT between two independant groups, in order to answer the research question
# For instance, whether concrete words are easier for processing

t.test(rt1000_inv~ Concreteness_category , data = data1)

# 3. Checking the defferences in RT between two dependant groups, in order to answer the research question
# such as: Does the stimuli presentation duration have the impact on word recognition?
# For this purpose, we are using t test for dependant samples
# Why these are dependant samples - condition with 1000 and 1500 ms? Well, because the same stimuli (words) were used
# in both of the conditions
# This is why in the matrix we have those RTs in separate columns

### Correlation, regression ###

# load packages
library(readxl)
library(lme4)

# read wide data
dat <- read_excel("simulated_data.xlsx")

# some things to get to know your data
summary(dat) # descriptive statistics of your data
head(dat) # check first 6 rows of a dataset
colnames(dat) # get the list of the names of the columns -- your variables
dim(dat) # see the dimensions of the data (number of rows, number of columns)

### Correlations

# To get a specific variable, you need to instruct R to get the data, and the name of the column
# here, we will use the method that looks like:
# [NAME OF THE DATA]$[NAME OF THE COLUMN]
# in our case you write: dat$logF

# testing correlation between (log) Frequency and Concreteness
cor.test(dat$logF, dat$Concreteness)

# plotting the data for (log) Frequency and Concreteness
png("c_Freq_Conc.png", width = 400, height = 400) # create a file you want to plot to ("create new file")
plot(dat$logF, dat$Concreteness) # plotting
dev.off() # informing R to stop writing to the file you opened two lines ago

# Spearman correlation
cor.test(dat$Arousal, dat$Concreteness, method = "spearman")
# method argument allows you to vary the correlation method
# "pearson" will give you the same method as in the first correlation we tested

# Point-biserial correlation
cor.test(dat$Concreteness_category, dat$logF)
# although no method is specified, R knows that one variable has only two levels

# Practice for later: try to correlate other variables in the dataset

### Regression

# you will need so-called long form data, where each participant response in an experiment will be one row
# read long data
datl <- read_excel("simulated_data_long.xlsx")

# some things to get to know your data
summary(datl) # descriptive statistics of your data
head(datl) # check first 6 rows of a dataset
colnames(datl) # get the list of the names of the columns -- your variables
dim(datl) # see the dimensions of the data (number of rows, number of columns)

# for now, we will just consider RTs for words exposed for 1500 ms
# here we create a new dataset that contains just 1500 ms exposition
datl_1500 <- datl[datl$Stim_duration == "1500ms",]

reg_model_1 <- lm(RT ~ Concreteness, data = datl_1500)

abline(reg_model_1, col = "green", lwd = 2)
